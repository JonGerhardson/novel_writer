As he sits in his tub meditating on existence (and refusing to tell us his name), the people around him--his girlfriend, Edmondsson, the Polish painters in his kitchen--each in their own way further enables his peculiar lifestyle, supporting his eccentric quest for immobility. But an invitation to the Austrian embassy shakes up his stable world, prompting him to take a risk and leave his bathroom . . .
